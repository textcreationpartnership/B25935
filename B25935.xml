            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Stubborn and Ungrateful <hi>Jew,</hi> whom all the Favours and Miracles of Heaven could never endear unto his God, even after his prodigious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery, and drowning of his Enemies in the Red Sea, still murmurs against his Leaders, and still turns I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater to his Maker. And does his Patient God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear? Does he extend his Mercies? Strange Patience!<note place="margin">Sic Deus dilexit mundum ut fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um suum unige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum daret, St, Jo. cap. <hi>3,</hi> v. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> unheard of Clemency! He sends his only begotten Son into the World, to guide, instruct, and give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Salvation to his People, thinking they would respect him, embrace his Doctrine, obey his Commands, follow his Counsels, and imitate his Vertues. <hi>Verebuntur Filium meum. They will reverence my Son.</hi> St. <hi>Matth.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205658:3"/> chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 37. In vain my God in vain. He derides his Innocency, he scoffs at his Sanctity, he scorns his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, persecutes his Justice, condemns his Doctrine as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and obstinately declares he will not follow it. <hi>Recede à nobis, scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, we will not the knowledge of thy ways, Job chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 14. Though each Paragraph of the Law stile him Holy, all the Prophets celebrate him as a Just Man, all the antient Figures represent him innocent, though the Angel proclaim him Saviour of the world, though the Eternal God name him the Beloved of his Heart, tho' the People reverence him as a Prophet, <hi>Hic est Jesus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheta. This is Jesus the Prophet,</hi> St. <hi>Matth. chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 11. and declare he had done all things well, tho' the Devils adore him as Son of God, in fine, tho' convinced by all the Oracles of Scripture, and his own Broad Seal of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that he is the true <hi>Messias</hi> and Saviour of the World, yet he will not receive him. <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare super nos. We will not have this Man reign over us,</hi> St. <hi>Luke chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 15. So little impression can the Preaching, Example, and Miracles of an Incarnate Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work upon his Stony Heart. But what? shall his Stubborness conquer the Almighty, and Impiety banish Vertue in spight of Heaven? No. The God of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, the Author of Sanctity, Divine Truth, and great Champion of Vertue, Christ Jesus, makes a solemn Challenge to day, in the face of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to his impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies the High Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, in vindication of the Innocency of his Life, the Sanctity of his Manners, and Infallibility of his Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Secure then of his own Innocency, and full of Godlike Majesty, he assaults them with a <hi>Quis ex vobis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who of you shall accuse me of sin?</hi> He dares them to shew wherein he has offended. Tell me, have I sinned against my God or my Neighbour? Have I not observed the great Commandements towards them both,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205658:3"/>
               <hi>Love thy God above all things, and thy neighbour as thy self?</hi> Tell me in what have I transgressed? Have I ever violated the least <hi>Iota,</hi> the least title of the Law Divine, or Human? I have Preached in your Synagogues, I have spoke openly; examin my Doctrine, if it be not coherent with the Law and Prophets, if it be not Divine, if it be not from God. I have taught daily in the Temple, in your hearing, shew me a word that I have not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the brightest evidence of irrefragable Miracles. <hi>Quis ex vobis? Who of you shall accuse me of sin?</hi> Can your <hi>Caesars?</hi> Can your <hi>Herods?</hi> Have I not punctually obey'd their Orders? Have I not paid them Tribute with all exactness? Have I not given strict command to all my Followers, next unto God to give <hi>Caesar</hi> his due? <hi>Quis ex vobis?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who of you?</hi> &amp;c. Can your High Priests? Have I not commanded Respect and Obedience to the Chair of <hi>Moses?</hi> Can the Sinner or Publican? Have I not been zealous for his Eternal Salvation? Did I not daily invite him to Repentance, offer him Pardon, and promise him eternal Reward in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Ask <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican, demand of <hi>Magdalen</hi> the Sinner, put the query to <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Zacheus. Quis ex vobis?</hi> Can the Married? I have honoured their state with my Presence, and confirmed it by Miracle. Can the Widdows? I have supplied their wants by my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, commanded them to be honoured by my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and my self have raised their dead to comfort them in Afflictions. Ask the Widdow Woman of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> go to the Gates of <hi>Naum,</hi> and you will hear and see the clearest demonstrations. Can the Virgin? I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled her condition to the sublime degree of Angels. Can your Children? They were the bosom darlings of my Heart, and I have entailed Heaven upon them for their Inheritance. <hi>Sinite parvulos venire ad me. Suffer the little Children to come unto me,</hi> St. <hi>Math. chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 14. Can the Hungry Multitude? I fed them in the Desart by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205658:4"/> Prodigies. Can the Sick, Imprisoned, Lame, Leprous, Paralytick, or Possessed? Have I not visited them, cured their Infirmities, cast out Devils? What more? Of my Deeds the Dumb speak, the Blind see them, the Deaf hear 'em, and the Dead can give you Intelligence of them. <hi>Quis ex vobis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who of you shall accuse me of sin?</hi> In fine, he lays open the truth so clear before their eyes, that they could have no excuse for not embracing it. <hi>Si non venissem, &amp; locutus eis fuissem, peccatum non haberent: nunc autem excusationem non habent. If I had not come, and spoken to them, they should not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin,</hi> St. <hi>John chap.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 22. And then demands. <hi>Si veritatem dico vobis, quare non creditis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi? If I say the truth why do you not believe me?</hi> St. <hi>John chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 47. But what return? The People indeed, ravished with the resplendent truth of his Heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, applaud him with a <hi>Nunquam sic locutus est homo. Never did man speak as this Man,</hi> St. <hi>John chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 47. yet the proud and haughty Pharisee, having nothing but meer Negatives to oppose, impudently Blasphemes, <hi>Nos scimus quia hic homo peccator est. We know that this man is a sinner,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 9.24. and consequently his Doctrine cannot be true, which filling the <hi>Jews</hi> with Envy, they take up Stones like unto their Hearts to throw at him. <hi>Tulerunt ergo lapides ut jacerent in eum. They took Stones therefore to cast at him,</hi> St. <hi>John chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 59; call a Council and Condemn the Innocent, <hi>Reus est mortis. He is guilty of death,</hi> St. <hi>Math.</hi> 26. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 66.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ch. Aud.</hi> I will not wast my Time, nor your devout Attention, in accusing the stubborn <hi>Jew</hi> of Sin, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Divine call of his <hi>Messias;</hi> I leave it to that dreadful day, when he shall see him whom he Crucified coming in the Clouds with Majestie. There is a Christian <hi>Jew,</hi> I mean the obstinate Sinner, (for so he is, and so I call him) whom I accuse,</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:205658:4"/>
            <p>First, of a horrible Sin, in slighting the Inspirations and Graces of Almighty God, that daily invite him to Repentance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will demonstrate the evident danger he puts the Eternal Salvation of his Soul in, by deferring his Conversion to the last.</p>
            <p>Dear Jesus, I beseech you by that burning Zeal with which you sought the Salvation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> enlighten my Understanding, inflame my Will, and influence my Words with such Force and Energy, that piercing into the hearts of my Auditory, I may awake them out of that dangerous and soul-killing Lethargy too too many sleep in; by your bitter death and passion grant, that in the most terrible hour of death, on which depends the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or misery of Eternity, the Enemy of Souls may never insult over any one here, with a <hi>Praevalui adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus eum. I have got the Victory, Psal.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 5. I humbly beg it by the Intercession of your Virgin Mother, whom I salute with the Angel. <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>IF I should accuse any here of Imprudence in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Concernes, I were justly to be condemned of a rash Imputation: You are all wise. For who of you has not the end of his employment lively fixt before his Eyes? Who provides not all necessary means? Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays in the speedy execution of them? Who embraces not all opportunities of obtaining it? Each step you take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards it. All your Study and Labours, your Care and Industry, your Thoughts in private, your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in publick, your Conferences with Friends, your Vows in the day, your Wakings in the night, meet here as in their beloved Center. After this each motion of your Heart breaths, each aspiration of your Soul mounts to this as to its sphere of rest. This raises the Scholar to

               <p>THE most deluding Fallacy on which the obdurate Sinner builds the delay of his Conversion, is a presumptive confidence in the Mercies of Almighty God, so much the more treacherous and deceitful, because it carries an outward shew of Vertue. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> takes him to task, and thus discourses. <hi>Dicis,</hi> says he, <hi>Alii mali fuerunt, &amp; salvi facti sunt, dabit &amp; mihi spatium paenitentiae.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were bad and are saved; <hi>David</hi> was an Adulterer, <hi>Zacheus</hi> a Publican, <hi>Saul</hi> a Persecuter, and <hi>Magdalen</hi> a Sinner, and he will give me time to repent. So they speak who sin with confidence, and, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> said, are bad because God is good. The Saint replies and asks. <hi>An vere dabit spatium paenitentiae? Fortasse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, dabit.</hi> But will he really give you time to repent? Perchance, say you, he will. The Saint urges very home. <hi>Dicis fortasse? memento quod de anima loqueris. Do you say perchance? Remember that you speak of your Soul.</hi> In a business of so great concern, then which no man has, or can have a greater, do you proceed with the uncertainty of a perchance? When with so much Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity you may put your self almost in security of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? You never admit of these doubts or uncertainties in the meanest affairs of the World. Nay, is your Friend condemned by some unfortunate accident to the fatal stroak of death, do you not use all possible care, all imaginable means, do you not imploy all your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and Forces, to repeal the Sentence, to obtain his pardon? Why then must only the business of your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation be managed with the uncertainty of time, which is not in your power. <hi>Fortasse dabit.</hi> And how numerous are they to whom God has not given time to provide for the main concern, and yet these very men had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205658:8"/> continually in their Mouths. <hi>Fortasse dabit. Perchance he will give us time to repent;</hi> they spent their days in Feasting, and lived pleasantly. It's true, says St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and I err if you do not find written in the Gospel, with the Golden Characters of Light and Truth, that God promises <hi>pardon to all Sinners that repent:</hi> But though you had a hundred thousand eyes, you will never find registred by the Pen of God, in any page of the sacred Volumes, that he has promised a Sinner <hi>time to repent. Nemo ergo sibi promittat quod Evangelium non promittit. Let no man therefore promise himself that which the Gospel does not promise.</hi> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> De verbis Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Ser. 16.</p>
               <p>But say what I will, my Christian <hi>Jew</hi> is become a <hi>Rabbi</hi> in the Synagogue of the Obstinate. He tells me with his confederates in <hi>Isaiah. Percussimus faedus cum morte &amp; cum Inferno fecimus pactum, Isaiah</hi> 28.15. He has made a truce with Death, and struck up a bargain with Hell. What? That Death shall not seize upon you unprovided? That it shall give you time by a perfect contrition and sorrow for your Sins to reconcile your self to Almighty God, to arm your self with the rites of the Church for that dangerous passage, that your death should be all mild, all pleasant, all melodious and joyful, that happy, as old <hi>Simeon,</hi> you shall close your Eyes with Jesus in your Arms, and depart in peace, singing a <hi>Nunc dimittis servum tuum Domine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now thou dost dismiss, O Lord, thy Servant according to thy word in peace, because mine eyes have seen thy Salvation, St.</hi> Luke <hi>ch.</hi> 2? <hi>And we have made a bargain with Hell.</hi> That you shall be free from all temptations, that the Devils shall not molest you, that Hell shall not devour you? But you have cheated your self, as all the Adversaries of Vertue and Truth always do, either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or willfully taking a Sentence, and not minding the Context. Had you read on, you had found a Salve to that damnable errour in the same place. <hi>Et delebitur
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205658:8"/> foedus vestrum cum morte,</hi> Isaiah <hi>the</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And your league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with Hell shall not stand.</hi> But above all, methinks that terrible <hi>Ego vado quaeretis me &amp; in peccato vestro moriemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, St.</hi> Joh. 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 21. <hi>v. I go, you shall seek me, and shall die in your sin;</hi> Threatned by our Blessed Saviour to the <hi>Jews,</hi> should strike a terror into the most obdurate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. There will be then a time for certain, when you shall seek God and not find him, when you shall call upon him and not be heard. The darkness of approaching death will hide him from your sight, and you that have not found him by the lights he gave you in your life, will certainly never find him in the shades of death. In a word,<note place="margin">Hoc est Christum male querere in peccato suo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, &amp; in pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to suo morietur, qui in peccato suo permanet usque ad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> that Sinner seeks Christ, but finds him not, who repents too late, that is, lets Death surprize him in Sin, says Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bede.</hi> Continue your favourable attention and I will prove it.</p>
               <p>The lamentations of the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she could not find her beloved are certain, the cause uncertain. <hi>Quaesivi in lectulo meo quem diligit anima mea, &amp; non inveni,</hi> Cant. ch. 3. <hi>I have sought in my little bed whom my Soul loveth, and have not found him.</hi> To omit other the reason in my opinion, why she could not find him, may be, because she only sought him in the bed of Sickness, when the darkness of death grew thick upon her, because the Sun of Justice seldom or never enlightens those horrid shades with the rays of Mercy. That is, you that expect to find God merciful on your death-bed, will be deceived. In vain you expect the health of your Soul, among the mortal distempers of your Body. It is in vain to think to gain Eternity in a moment. It is in vain to cover your self with the Ashes of Pennance, when the Dust of your Sepulchre is near. In vain do your eyes pour out scalding Tears, when a cold sweat of Death runs down your Cheeks. Your sighs are illtim'd for Pennance, when you groan for life. What force can Pennance have in such
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205658:9"/> a weakness of Members? What fruits can she produce, planted in the Ashes of a Carcass. Vertues will not grow in a heart void of natural heat and strength. Wo then to the Soul that only seeks her Spouse on her Death-bed. And wo to thee, stubborn Sinner, that only beg'st mercy when thy gasping Soul hangs upon thy dying lips.</p>
               <p>I do not intend to condemn the Pennance of many in their last Agony;<note place="margin">Potest nobis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremi temporis Indulgentia sub venire, at periculosissima est in ultimum diem promiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We may be so fortunate as to find mercy at the last hour: <hi>but it is a most dangerous security we promise our selves in the last day.</hi> For it does not often happen that he that has lived a Fool all his life, becomes a Wife man at his death. And can there be a greater Fool than he who commits his eternal concerns to a dying life? Not a feeble but strong Voice is requisite to plead a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of that Importance; it demands a weeping Eye not a dying one; exacts a grieving Soul, not a dead body. Because says St. <hi>Aug.</hi> Serm. 66. <hi>de temp. Parum est pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori paenitere nisi paenitentiam peregerit. It little avails a sinner to repent, unless he perform his Pennance.</hi> Because as we esteem not the Tree, but the Fruit, nor is the Plant commendable that renders no Fruit to the Gardiner, so Almighty God values not a fruitless Sorrow or barren Repentance. Our Saviour and St. <hi>John</hi> exclaim, <hi>Facite fructus dignos paenitentiae. Yield fruits worthy of Pennance,</hi> St. <hi>Luke ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 9. But in such anguish of Soul, in such pain of body, in a head full of other concerns, in a distracted mind, in a heart not only barren of good deeds, but holy thoughts, what Fruits can Pennance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? And will you yet defer your Conversion? Do you know it? He that procrastinates in an affair of that Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, contests with his everlasting ruin. Pennance is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205658:9"/> a traffick you may purchase a blessed Eternity with: But who is that slothful and unfortunate Servant that hid it under ground?

And if you are not able to satisfy for your sins in that weak condition, how is it possible for you to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome an army of Sins now in possession of your Soul? How will you conquer those Legions of Devils that lye encamped round about to defend it? Good God! Those sins that so many Preachers thundring the Judgments of the Almighty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, could not drive out!

Paenitentia quae a moriente tantum petitur, timeo ne &amp; ipsa moriatur. That Pennance which a dying Man only begs to do, I am afraid it will die.</hi> I fear she will be defeated, I fear she will die; and as the Body becomes a spoil to the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Death, so she will fall a Victim of Sin, and a Prey to the Devils. Therefore if you intend to become victorious in the last and terrible battel, why do you not quicken your Pennance with the vigour of Youth, arm it with the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Mortification, and curbing your unbridled Passions, strengthen it with noble Resolutions, and the powerful assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christian Vertues?

                     </gap>er. <hi>57.</hi> de Paen,</note> You staid perchance for old age to rob you of those charming Locks, before you offered them to your dear Lord, to insnare him in your love. You demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red perchance till your sins left you, that you might run to God. <hi>Ʋt cognovit.</hi> Christian Auditory. <hi>Ʋt cognovit.</hi> As soon as ever she understood that her Heavenly Physitian was at hand, presently, without any delay, changing her sinful boldness into a fruitful confidence, she entred where he was, and prostrate at his Divine Feet, the Pillars of a <hi>non plus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> to her wicked life, pleaded her pardon with the silent groans of a contrite heart, and drown'd her sins in a Sea of Tears. <hi>Ʋt cognovit. As soon as ever she knew.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Dominum dum inveniri potest. Seek the Lord whilst he may be found.</hi> Now, this day, this moment. When he calls you, when he offers you his Grace, when he expects your return.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:205658:10"/> Do not defer till the night of Death surprise you. <hi>Venit nox quando nemo potest operari. The night comes when no man can labour.</hi> It will then be too late. You'll seek your Saviour but not find him. <hi>Et in peccato,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then you'll die in your sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reason which renders thy repentance almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, is thy custom of sinning, which once having got possession of thy Soul, is hardly rooted out. Because, says St. <hi>Aug. Consuetudo est quaedam habituata natura. Custom is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond nature.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> answers thee, <hi>That when thy Vices are become thy Manners, there is no place for a remedy. Tunc desinit esse remedio locus, ubi quae fuerint vitia mores fiunt.</hi> You read a strange example of this in the third Book of Kings, 13 <hi>chap.</hi> King <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> by his frequent Idolatry, was become harder to the voice of God then the Stones he adored. The Prophet <hi>Semeia,</hi> by Divine order, goes to him, and finds him standing upon the Altar, but directs his Embassy to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar not to the King. <hi>Altar, Altar.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> astonish'd hereat, asks him. <hi>Cum lapide verba facis?</hi> O Man of God, what do you do? Do you think God has given the Marble ears to hear your voice? Is your Tongue an Instrument of steel, that can imprint upon it the Character of your words? Certainly upon this Altar you sacrifice your Words to the Winds. Why do you not speak to the King who willingly hears you? Every one will judge you a mad Man, to treat Stones as Men, and Men as Stones. Do you think the King will not give you audience? Much less will the Stones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you an answer. If the one will not hear what you say, do you believe the other will execute your Commands? If <hi>Jeroboam</hi> has not ears to hear you, much less has the Marble capacity to understand you. But it was not so. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet found more hardness in the stubborn heart of the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate King, than in the senseless Stone; and his voice which was not heard by the one was obey'd by the other, opening its Bowels, and delivering out the commanded Victim, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the same voice the stubborn King stopt his Ears to. <hi>Etiam quando rex minus compos est sensuum quam lapis, &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divit lapis, ipse lapis in scissuras diffractus est, &amp; victimam
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:205658:11"/> effudit, homo ille non audivit. St.</hi> Chrys. In <hi>proem.</hi> in <hi>Isaiah.</hi> This we see daily, and lament. How many Preachers by Sermons, Exhortations, and pious Discourses, tell the obstinate and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sinner, the danger he is in by delaying his Conversion. They propose to him the patience of his God, his frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to repentance, his threats, his promises, his rewards, his punishments, nothing moves him. <hi>Percussisti eos &amp; non dolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt,</hi> says <hi>Jeremiah</hi> of the obstinate. <hi>Thou hast stricken them and they have not grieved, chap.</hi> 5. In vain does Heaven punish here, in vain do you propose divine Benefits. <hi>Ipsi fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt rebelles lumini.</hi> They were rebellious to the Light, says <hi>Job</hi> of the same, <hi>ch.</hi> 54. A cursed habit of Sinning has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thy heart more hard than the very Stones.</p>
               <p>The Divine St. <hi>Aug.</hi> has a gentile reflection upon three Dead, raised by our Blessed Saviour. The Prince of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues Daughter dies. The Heavenly Physitian only takes her by the hand, not so much to feel the motion of her Pulse, as to give it; bids her rise, and she returns to Life. The Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Son of <hi>Naim,</hi> interpreted the City of Beauties, dies in the flower of his Youth, and Jesus meets the disconsolate Widdow at the City Gates, calls the young man with an <hi>Adolescens tibi dico surge,</hi> and in obedience to the command he stands up alive, and Jesus dries up the Tears of the afflicted Mother with the joyful sight of her raised Son. <hi>Lazarus</hi> dies and is buried, and Christ is troubled, sighs for grief, breaks out into Tears, groans, and with a loud cry calls him, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zare, veni foras. Lazarus, come forth.</hi> And thus he rescues him from the Jaws of death, and brings him alive from the Sepulchre. But what sort of death is this, my dear Jesus, that will not give <hi>Lazarus</hi> the light of life, unless your all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening Eyes set in a Sea of grief? That will not open the Grave and give up her dead, unless you open your Sacred Mouth to groans? That will see you, Author of all Joy, full of all sadness, before she rejoice the Spectators with their rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Friend. Why was there not need of this in the others? Whence this novelty? St. <hi>Aug.</hi> answers the query. Because in the young Persons was expressed a Sin newly committed;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:205658:11"/> not so much, out of Malice as Frailty. But this signifies a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of sinning. <hi>Cum consuetudinis malae quasi mole terrena pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur animus, quasi in S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pulchro jam putet. When the Soul is oppressed by a bad habit, as with a heap of Earth, it corrupts as it were in her Sepulcher.</hi> And therefore the voice of our Saviour was sufficient alone to raise the First. But here <hi>Fremuit in Spiritu, &amp; rursus infremuit, &amp; deinde magna voce exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, Lazare veni foras. He groaned in Spirit, and groan'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and then he cry'd out with a great voice,</hi> Lazarus <hi>come forth.</hi> To demonstrate how difficult a thing it is for a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be Converted, and do Pennance at the hour of his Death. It is a strange observation of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> upon the Epistle of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where mention is made of the general Judgment. At the first sound of the Angelical Trumpet, which must summon all Men to the vale of <hi>Josaphat,</hi> the dead will presently arise and present themselves. But to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which remain on earth, the voice of the Archangel will not be enough, the voice and command of God must be added. What means this? That it is easier to raise a dead man to life, than Convert an obstinate Sinner. This will sooner come from his Grave, than that will leave his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life. This will sooner awake from the sleep of death, than that will rise from the Lethargy of Sin. And God is sooner heard in Graves than in Towns and Cities.</p>
               <p>But my obstinate Sinner still replies, that the mercies of God are above all his Works. That he will not the death of a Sinner, but rather that he be converted and live. That his Mercies have most of all triumphed in the hour of death. He has invited, even then, the worst of Sinners to pardon. <hi>Manasses</hi> after a wicked life, became a Penitent. He invited <hi>Judas</hi> with a kiss of Peace, and saved a Thief on the Cross. It's very true, but here lies an errour that has Peopled Hell. Are you sure, or do you only hope that he will invite you? <hi>Vix dici potest,</hi> says St. <hi>Aug. quantos haec inanis spei umbra deceperit. It can hardly be expressed how many this empty sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of vain hope has deluded.</hi> Serm. 100. de temp. This it was that ruined <hi>Judas</hi> and made him <hi>dux eorum qui compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henderunt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205658:12"/> Jsum. Captain of them that apprehended Jesus.</hi> And whence so great boldness, such hardness of heart in an Apostle, a worker of Miracles, who had lived three years in the School and Company of Christ? St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> found the Origin and discovered it for the Instruction and Correction of the like to him. <hi>Confidebat nimium in lenitate Magistri, quae res illum magis confudit, &amp; omni venia privavit. He confided too much in the Meekness of his Master, which did more confound him, and deprive him of all pardon.</hi> The sweet behaviour of Christ to him, which ought to have made him love him more dearly, rendred him odious and despicable. He never saw him hurt any one, but do good to all, and therefore he betray'd him, because he did not fear him, but vainly confided in his Mercy. And tho' <hi>Manasses</hi> clos'd his wicked life with a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent death; yet his graceless Son <hi>Ammon</hi> following the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious steps of his Father died as he lived. Nor must you urge tha example of the good Thief. For in the day the Son of God died to redeem man, some extraordinary priviledge might be granted. But turn from the right hand to the left, it is a short passage, and you will see, that tho' he was converted and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet his Companion, and a thousand of the standers by, died as they lived. This then is an error the blind may see palmed on your self, not upon God. For he protests by the mouth of the Wiseman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. That he called, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, you despised his Counsels, neglected his reprehensions, and therefore he will laugh in your destruction, and scorn when tribulation and distress shall come upon you. <hi>Then,</hi> says he, <hi>they shall invocate me, and I will not hear them.</hi> Oh dear Sinner! What a terrible menace is this to a poor Soul, to be forsaken at the last, and cast off by Almighty God.</p>
               <p>But he has Eyes and will not see, Ears and will not hear, Feet and will not walk. He has affectedly lulled his Conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep with the drunkenness of his sins, the Trumpet of Death and Judgment cannot rouze him; and he intends to awake at his death, and live to heaven, who living was dead to Grace. Would you know what becomes of him? A Message is dispatch'd, for Mercy has given him over, and Justice will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205658:12"/> no longer indure him; perchance the same that was brought to King <hi>Ezechias</hi> on his Sick-bed. <hi>Dispone domui tuae, quia morieris tu &amp; non vives. Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and shalt not live, Isa. ch.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 1. A distemper sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses him, he is carried to his Bed, his affrighted Friends run to his aid, with weeping Eyes they beg of him <hi>Now,</hi> for <hi>Now</hi> is the time, or <hi>Never,</hi> to think on his Soul, to repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himself to God, they mind him with most earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, of his so often repeated promises, <hi>I will, I will, when I come to dye.</hi> And what does this deluded Soul answer? Thanks be to God he is not so ill as to think himself at that point, in that extremity as they Imagin, who wou'd have him die before his time, or modestly to hinder them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating what he would not hear, he gives his Friends many thanks in very obliging terms, and says he will do it speedily as soon as the dulness of his head clears up, the pain at his heart relents, which at present hinder him from performing any thing, with the seriousness a business of that importance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Jesus! As he spoke he fell out of his Senses, he has lost his speech, his eyes are set in his head, he breaths no more, he is dead. A punishment justly due to the merits of his Crime, that he who living never raised his Eyes to Heaven to desire it, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should not cast them down on hell to fear it, who living never thought on God, dying should forget himself. I am sorry I can't comfort his sad and afflicted Friends with a <hi>Requiescat in pace. The Lords peace be with him.</hi> The Antiphon that I wou'd have Sung before and after every Funeral Psalm, shou'd be that most true Sentence of St. <hi>Aug. It is the punishment of every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he forget himself when he comes to dye, who whilst he lived was forgetful of God.</hi>

It is thy God that thought himself mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unless thou wert happy; who after three and thirty years Preaching, Sweat, and Labour for thy sake, died that thou mayest live eternally. He is naked to cloath thee with the Robes of Immortality. He bows his Sacred head to give thee a kiss of Peace, he stretcheth forth his arms to embrace thee, he has his side pierced to open thee a passage to his heart to shew he loves thee; he is crowned with Thorns to Crown thee with a Diadem of Immortal Glory. Those Wounds from Head to Foot are thy Sins.<note place="margin">Ipse autem vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratus est prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter scelera no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra, Isa. <hi>53.5.</hi>

I leave thee then to plead thy own cause at the most severe Tribunal of Divine Justice.
